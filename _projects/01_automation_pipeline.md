### The Challenge
A local business was spending **5+ hours weekly** manually sorting invoices and merging sales data from various CSV files. 

### The Solution
I developed a **Class-based Python script** that:
- Automatically categorizes files into a structured directory.
- Merges fragmented datasets into a master report using **Pandas**.
- Generates an executive summary for stakeholders.

### Key Skills Demonstrated
- **Python Scripting** (OS, Shutil, Glob)
- **Data Engineering** (Pandas, Data Cleaning)
- **Workflow Automation**
